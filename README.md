This started out  as just a repo for me to dump class work and examples from a digital humanities class. Now, it's the start of a hockey site that will have each team's schedule, roster, about, stats for the team (and eventually players), trades, team caps, and the draft board with up-to-date picks. Eventually... Hopefully..
Thanks for visiting!
