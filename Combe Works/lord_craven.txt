AN

HEROIC EPISTLE

TO

LORD CRAVEN.


    Too long have Britain's sons with proud disdain
    Survey'd the gay Patrician's titled train,
    Their various merit scann'd with eye severe,
    Nor learn'd to know the peasant from the peer:
    At length the Gothic ignorance is o'er,
    And vulgar brows shall scowl on LORDS no more;
    Commons shall shrink at each ennobled nod,
    And ev'ry lordling shine a demigod:
    By CRAVEN taught, the humbler herd shall know,
    How high the Peerage, and themselves how low.
    Illustrious Chief, your eloquence divine
    Shall raise the whole right honourable line;
    All shall with joy your bright example view,
    And love the tribe that boasts a son like you;
    While Liberty shall lead you to her throne
    With jocund hand, and claim you for her own.

    When warm in youth, on Isis' learned shore,
    You early listen'd to her sacred lore;
    Abhorr'd the dull confinement of the schools,
    Contemn'd their statutes, and despis'd their rules.
    Ev'n when to burst their bonds your ardor fail'd,
    And law, tyrannic law, at last prevail'd,
    Tho' forc'd a while to bend beneath the yoke,
    Its weight your dauntless spirit never broke,
    Still rankled in your breast the fatal wound,
    Tho' years had o'er it roll'd their circling round,
    On [A]SCROPE, tho' late, you rear'd your threat'ning arm,
    And shew'd the will without the pow'r to harm.

    With Freedom's warmth, tho' thus your bosom glow'd,
    From no licentious heat the ardour flow'd
    When peaceful leaders rul'd with gentle sway,
    Still were you first their mandates to obey;
    Tho' Proctors, arm'd with all th' insulting pride
    Of legal pow'r, your daring soul defy'd,
    Yet to the ruler of the festive band
    You bow'd, nor scorn'd the toast-master's command;
    Obedient drank each penal draft of wine,
    And only fear'd a salt and water fine.

    So burn'd your youthful heart with Freedom's flame,
    Such the fair dawning of your future fame;
    But when by time matur'd, the Peerage spread
    Its dazzling lustre round your honor'd head,
    The sacred fire that warm'd before your breast,
    Blaz'd boldly forth to all mankind confess'd,
    Immortal Liberty with blooming charms,
    Woo'd you so strongly to her heavenly arms,
    So fierce your passion, that you could not bear
    Another vot'ry should her favors share;
    For still your heart Othello's plan approves,
    Nor keeps a corner in the thing it loves
    For others uses; those who madly brave
    Attack the rights you have, or think you have,
    Shall weep their rashness, that in luckless hour,
    Oppos'd th' omnipotence of lordly pow'r.
    When SEYMOUR insolently dar'd invade,
    Manors by your possession sacred made,
    From feasts you deign'd to grace, you wip'd his name,
    And gave him o'er to infamy and shame:
    And when, tho' late, he made a bold appeal
    To arms, from frowning Peers and fawning zeal,
    And dar'd attempt with sacrilegious sword,
    To offer equal combat to a LORD,
    Sudden your noble limbs your coursers bore,
    From Berkshire's hills to Avon's distant shore:
    And eager to preserve from foul disgrace,
    Th' unsullied honors of a noble race,
    Rather than have it said you meanly stood
    To stain your faulchion with Plebeian blood,
    You yielded bravely to a harsher fate,
    And made submissions to the man you hate.
    To save their dignity from scandal's breath,
    Thousands have fearless fac'd approaching death;
    Your dauntless action merits more applause,
    Who courted infamy in honor's cause.

    Proceed! proceed! and still our wond'ring eyes
    With deeds magnanimous like these surprize,
    And lest some wretch, phlegmatic, dull, and cold,
    Without applause such actions should behold,
    Aloud to list'ning crowds your worth proclaim,
    Yourself the herald of your deathless fame.
    To spacious Berks your dignity avow,
    From Buscot's meads, to Windsor's lofty brow,
    Till LOVEDEN's daring insolence is o'er,
    And POWNEY cross your fav'rite schemes no more;
    Your sacred game, till lawless SEYMOUR spare,
    Nor hot-brain'd PYE another challenge bear.
    Shall humble Squires presume, by act or word,
    T' oppose the wishes of a mighty LORD;
    On high affairs attempt to give their voice,
    Or in elections e'er avow their choice;
    Pour in your rabble to each factious town,
    And Freedom's sounds, by shouting numbers drown,
    Till Thames' unpeopled waves by READING glide,
    Without one bargeman left to chear the tide;
    And NEWBURY's desart streets lament in vain,
    Their servile inmates gone to swell your train.
    Stout FERDINANDO, your obsequious slave,
    Once a rude ruffian, now a pliant knave,
    With Stentor's voice shall swell your pageant pride,
    And boldly thunder nonsense on your side:
    The gentle Colonel, simpering SELLWOOD too,
    His face with port and patriot-ardor blue,
    With vacant eye shall view your great intent,
    Shall scratch his empty head, and smile assent.
    There too my muse, with rough, tho' honest song,
    Shall chant your virtues to the admiring throng,
    Display your various worth in humble lays,
    And teach the gaping rabble how to praise,
    Re-echo to their ears your fav'rite word,
    And shew respect should always wait MY LORD.
    Perhaps, (indulge your Poet's fairy dream),
    Perhaps my verse adorn'd by such a theme,
    May in some bark, our navy sail t' explore,
    Be safely wafted to the Atlantic shore:
    How will those pious Chiefs delight to hear
    The kindred virtues of a British Peer?
    How will thy deeds enchant, with gentle sway,
    The Patriot sons of Massachuset's Bay?
    For all your ardor fires the illustrious train,
    In Council bold, but bashful on the plain:
    How will their grateful bosoms love the verse,
    Whose honest lines such great exploits rehearse?
    I see their hands prepare the verdant bough,
    I feel their laurel wreaths surround my brow;
    While that long-honour'd strain, whose magic charms
    So oft has called the gallant race to arms,
    Shall now at length give place to newer lays,
    And Yanky-doodle yield to CRAVEN'S praise.


                        THE END.


FOOTNOTE:

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
