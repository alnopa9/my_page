               <h1>The Oblivion Crisis</h1>
               
               <p>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="good">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span> was
                     assassinated</span> and <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>
                     was destroyed</span>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
                  down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.
               </p>
               
               
               <p><span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="evil">assassins</span> first attacked the
                     <span class="good">Emperor</span></span> in the
                  <span class="location">White Gold Tower</span>. While the <span class="good">Blades</span> held <span class="evil">them</span> back,
                  <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="good">Emperor</span> made <span class="good">his</span> way down to the
                     <span class="location">dungeons</span></span>, to a <span class="location">secret escape
                     route</span> built into <span class="location">one of the prison cells</span>. For
                  reasons known only to <span class="good">himself</span>, the <span class="good">Emperor</span>
                  <span class="QuestEvent">pardoned the fortunate <span class="neutral">prisoner</span></span> in that <span class="location">cell</span>. Some say the
                  <span class="neutral">prisoner</span> reminded <span class="good">him</span> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <span class="QuestEvent">moment of
                     prophecy</span>. Whatever the case, the <span class="neutral">prisoner</span> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
                  <span class="location">Empire</span> and <span class="location">Tamriel</span> - surely a sign that
                  the gods themselves were at work.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The pursuing <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">assassins</span> killed the
                     <span class="good">Blades</span> bodyguards</span> in a relentless
                  series of sneak attacks. Eventually <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">they</span>
                     struck down the <span class="good">Emperor</span>
                     <span class="good">himself</span></span>. Before <span class="good">he</span> fell, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="good">Uriel Septim VII</span> gave the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> to
                     the <span class="neutral">prisoner</span></span>, who somehow
                  <span class="QuestEvent">made it out of the <span class="location">Imperial sewers</span></span> and
                  into the light of day.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <span class="evil">daedric cultists</span> known as the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn</span>. (Those who still suspect the <span class="neutral">Dark Brotherhood</span> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
                  needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <span class="neutral">Dark Brotherhood</span> would never be so foolish as to
                  <span class="QuestEvent">effectively declare war on the Empire</span> and thus ensure their
                  complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <span class="evil">Mythic
                     Dawn</span>.)
               </p>
               
               
               
               
               <p>The <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> next surfaced at <span class="location">Weynon
                     Priory</span> near <span class="location">Chorrol</span>. <span class="good">Jauffre</span>, secret <span class="good">Grandmaster of the
                     <span class="good">Blades</span></span> and head of the
                  <span class="location">priory</span>, <span class="QuestEvent">took possession of the
                     <span class="QuestItem">amulet</span></span>. <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="neutral">messenger</span> was sent off to <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> to find a lowly <span class="good">priest</span> named <span class="good">Martin</span>.
                  Unbeknownst even to <span class="good">himself</span>, <span class="good">Martin</span> was the bastard son of <span class="good">Uriel Septim VII</span>, and the last heir to the Ruby
                  Throne. <span class="good">He</span> alone could use the
                  <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
                  barrier between <span class="location">Tamriel</span> and <span class="location">Oblivion</span>, and save
                  the world from the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn</span> plot.
               </p>
               
               
               <p><span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="neutral">prisoner</span> arrived at <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> to find <span class="location">it</span> overrun by <span class="evil">daedra</span> that had poured in
                  from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
                  the
                  Oblivion Crisis. How <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="neutral">prisoner</span> closed
                     the gate</span> is not recorded. Once closed, <span class="good">Martin</span> and the surviving <span class="location">Kvatch</span>
                  <span class="good">guardsmen</span> drove back the <span class="evil">daedra</span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Now known as the <span class="hero">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span>, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="neutral">prisoner</span> and <span class="good">Martin</span>
                     returned to <span class="location">Weynon Priory</span></span>, only to find the
                  <span class="location">priory</span> sacked and the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> taken.
                  <span class="good">Jauffre</span> survived the attack, however, and
                  <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="hero-Jauffre-MartinSeptim">three of them</span>
                     made their way to <span class="location">Cloud Ruler Temple</span></span>, bastion of
                  the <span class="good">Blades</span>. This secret <span class="location">fortress</span> in
                  the <span class="location">mountains</span> outside <span class="location">Bruma</span> is
                  where <span class="good">Martin</span> was held safe while
                  <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="hero">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> searched for the lost
                     <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span></span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <span class="evil">Mythic
                     Dawn</span> was behind the <span class="QuestEvent">assassination and theft of the
                     <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span></span>, <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="hero">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> was sent to locate
                     the <span class="evil">cult</span></span>. With the help of
                  <span class="hero">Baurus</span>, a <span class="good">Blade</span> in the
                  service of the <span class="good">Emperor</span>, <span class="MartinSeptim-hero-Jauffre">they</span> somehow <span class="QuestEvent">used the
                     <span class="QuestItem">Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</span></span>,
                  esoteric works by the madman <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span>,
                  to direct <span class="MartinSeptim hero Jauffre">them</span> to the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn</span>'s secret <span class="location">lair</span>. Scholars
                  familiar with the <span class="QuestItem">Commentaries</span> claim the location is not directly
                  mentioned in <span class="QuestItem">them</span>. How <span class="MartinSeptim hero Jauffre">they</span> did this remains a mystery.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>No official records exist of how <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="hero">Hero of
                        <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> penetrated the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn</span>'s <span class="location">lair</span></span>
                  near <span class="location">Lake Arrius</span>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <span class="neutral">Hero</span> used <span class="QuestEvent">trickery and disguise</span>, but
                  that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span> was behind the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn</span>, and that the <span class="evil">group</span> worshiped the daedric prince <span class="evil">Mehrunes Dagon</span>. <span class="evil">Mankar
                     Camoran</span> believed <span class="evil">himself</span> to
                  be a direct descendant of the <span class="hero">Camoran Usurper</span>, the infamous
                  pretender to the throne of <span class="location">Valenwood</span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Somehow <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="neutral">Hero</span> escaped with the
                     <span class="QuestItem">Mysterium Xarxes itself</span></span>, the holy book of
                  the <span class="evil">Mythic Dawn cult</span>. <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span> fled to <span class="location">Oblivion</span> with the
                  <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>. With some effort and great risk to
                  <span class="good">his</span> sanity, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="good">Martin</span> deciphered the Mysterium
                     Xarxes</span> and intended to use <span class="QuestItem">it</span> to open a gateway
                  to <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span> in order to recover the
                  <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Before <span class="good">Martin</span> could perform the ritual
                  to open the gateway, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">Mehrunes
                        Dagon</span> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <span class="location">Bruma</span></span>. <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="hero">Hero of
                        <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> saved the <span class="location">city</span> and <span class="good">Martin</span>
                     by entering the gate and closing it</span> before a <span class="evil">daedric siege engine</span> could destroy <span class="location">Bruma</span>
                  and <span class="location">Cloud Ruler Temple</span>. Many songs and stories have been told of
                  this battle and I will not retell them here. The <span class="hero">Hero of <span class="location">Kvatch</span></span> was now also known as the <span class="hero">Savior of <span class="location">Bruma</span></span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>With the <span class="location">city</span> and <span class="location">Cloud Ruler
                     Temple</span> safe, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="good">Martin</span>
                     opened the portal to <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span>'s
                     "<span class="location">Paradise</span>"</span>. The details of what transpired in
                  this <span class="location">place</span> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
                  <span class="QuestEvent">the <span class="hero">Savior of <span class="location">Bruma</span></span> travelled to this <span class="location">Paradise</span>,
                     killed <span class="evil">Mankar Camoran</span>, and returned with
                     the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of Kings</span></span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>With the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> in hand, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="good">Martin Septim</span> presented <span class="good">himself</span> to the <span class="good">Elder
                        Council</span> to be crowned <span class="good">Emperor of all
                        <span class="location">Tamriel</span></span></span>. Once crowned <span class="good">he</span> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
                  <span class="location">Tamriel</span> from <span class="location">Oblivion</span>. In a last-ditch
                  attempt to stop <span class="good">him</span>, <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">Mehrunes Dagon</span> launched an assault on the
                     <span class="location">Imperial City</span>, opening several Oblivion Gates
                     within the <span class="location">capital</span> itself</span>. Uncrowned,
                  <span class="good">Martin</span> joined the battle in the <span class="location">city streets</span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p><span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">Mehrunes Dagon himself</span>
                     left <span class="location">Oblivion</span> and entered
                     <span class="location">Tamriel</span></span>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
                  Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
                  it was
                  too late to relighting the Fires. <span class="good">Martin
                     Septim</span> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="good">he</span> shattered the <span class="QuestItem">Amulet of
                        Kings</span> to become the <span class="good">avatar of the god
                        Akatosh</span> and do battle with <span class="evil">Mehrunes
                        Dagon</span></span>.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
                  <span class="QuestEvent"><span class="evil">Mehrunes Dagon</span> was
                     defeated and sent back to <span class="location">Oblivion</span></span>.
                  <span class="QuestEvent">The <span class="good">avatar of Akatosh</span> was
                     turned to stone</span> and can be seen to this day in the <span class="location">Temple of
                     the One</span> in the <span class="location">Imperial City</span>. With the
                  <span class="QuestItem">Amulet</span> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
                  Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <span class="location">Oblivion</span> is sealed
                  forever.
