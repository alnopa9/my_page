Cheese Straws
1-Cup Kraft Med or Sharp grated cheese. I use sharp
1-Stick Parkay Margarine
1-Cup flour (plain)
I add 1/8 teaspoon red pepper after after I double
    this recipe!
    Mix ingredients. Knead into a ball. It
    should be moist. Knead like making bread
    dough. Shape into very small balls. Use a
    fork and mash two ways. Put on cookie sheet
    after spraying with oil and cook at 350^o for
    fifteen minutes. Check. You might have to cook
    2 or 3 more minutes. Let cool. Place in
    container. I always double recipe, sometimes triple
                                            (over)
